## Context and Problem Statement

We were deciding on adding additional background images and more languages to the app

## Considered Options

* Extra Backgrounds
  - Option to choose between multiple backgrounds
* Extra Languages
  - Option to choose between multiple languages

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Extra Backgrounds and Extra Languages because

* Doesn't interfere with default usage
  - options do not affect normal usage for users who do not care about options
* Allows better customization
  - allows users to customize their experience more if they opt to
* More userbase
  - additional languages can draw in more users if they do not understand english (which is a large population)
