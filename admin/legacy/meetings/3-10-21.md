many features completed last minute on week 10

Team problems and improvements:

- Button stylization differing across different different web browsers
- Continuing as much testing (Jest, Cypress, etc.) as possible
  - Trying to break code
- Checking any last-portion UI bugs
- Responsiveness checks for screen sizes

- In general: finishing up the last touches, completing remaining features, and incorporating any remaining tests possible
