## Initial Critique
```
- we mentioned multiple features
  - except, not enough elaboration applied at the moment
  - for example: linking user stories directly into purpose of specific features in our app
  - which needs inspire which implementations?
  
- consider longevity of our work
  - which stretch goals are we considering?
  - what specific implementation designs in our bare-bone version will have to carry over into the stretch goals?
    - Example: hardcoding timer vs. passing in as parameters (if we later desire custom timing)
  
- tasks
  - basic requirements / basic workflow, but not part of minimum requirement
    - will therefore incorporate single button + counter for stats in UI and design
```

  
## UI Discussion
```
  - statistics page
  - doesn't feel there is a consistent flow
  - restructure information presentation for a natural flow
  - focus on a more longitudinal means of presentation
  
  - Consider scrolling and button-selecting for slide animations (compare them)
    - perhaps, incorporate side-menu that slides from side to show longitudinal data
    - favoring mobile device UI as approach to web browser presentation
    
  - Include further detail of tasks completed (new button + more important stat topics)
```

Briefly Gathered Notes

- "pointer" -- generic input device to use as asset for transitioning (works on both mobile and transition screen)
- smooth scrolling may be difficult to implement

## Personas: ##
```
- tieing into different features/ideas we plan
- directly attaching user personas into features (ie. THIS kind of need describes purpose of THIS implementation)
```

## Suggestion (rather than requirement)
```
- create event-flow diagram to show how user interacts with diagram)

- think about the main data strucutures that will be passed around
  - interface components; standardize the interface components
  - therefore, every group knows exactly what is expected to send out / pass /receive between all for efficiency and clarity

- be sure to break apart the spirints into more granular pieces
```

In general, more tweaks needed "here-and-there"; expand upon user personas and how they directly impact our implementations


## Closing thoughts (after Chad's discussions)
```
- Tasks
  - regular button (no need for table); click, next task
  - system know syou are going from tasks to task
    - counter task (new thing to features as a statistic
    
- Stats: using local storage (based on length of browser),,, until user clears cache, it stays there
- use cookies, avoid closing browsers
```
