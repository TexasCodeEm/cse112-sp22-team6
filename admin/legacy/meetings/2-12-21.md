    * Divided work transformed into issues on GitHub
  - Following agile progress for realistic estimations

```

### Closing Thoughts
```
a. Chad says we are in great position

b. Unit Testing
  - Dummy tests set up for some of functionality
  - Doc. templates submitted with parts for PRs
    - Nee dto write up some tests prior to PR submission, otherwise instant fail
  - Future sprint, set up higher-benchmark unit tests for finalizations

c. Concern: be sure not to push back too much testing
  - Even though code simple / easy to read, be sure to apply extra testing in case
  
d. Feature writer creating documentation/testing

e. Pipeline
  - Run tests, deploy, etc.
  - Functioning as intended so far
  
f. Graphics
  - Recommended to work svg
  - Look into svg graphics libraries
    * Graph in the stats page requires more time + learning curve
    * Consideration for figuring out graph implementation
