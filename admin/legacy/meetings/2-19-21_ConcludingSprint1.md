```

## Chad's Thoughts
```
a. "Will everything we aimed to complete be finished by Sprint 1's end?"
- Back-end of stats page is a stretch goal; is fine if not completed by then


b. "How do we feel about our original roadmap?"
- Will revisit during next planning meeting
- Sprint 2 seems fine; will just need to acount more for testing

- Sprint 3 will most-likely be revitalized
  * Further focus on more robust testing + finalizations
  
- Overall: planning/estimates seemed viable and most goals were achieved
  * Working on more realistic/detailed issues and time frames
  
  
c. "Should we change the way we assign/allocate work to people?"
- Will try to allocate more people to tougher tasks
  * Specifically, tasks taht become more difficult will be broken down further and split up amongst more members
  * More granular tasks
  * Can mix-up groups and the features that we all work on
  * To improve overall readability
  

d. "Progress on JSDocs?"
- Great progress so far
- All submitted PRs so far have included testing
- Functions properly commented
- Github Pages
  * Including descriptions of Members, Methods, global, etc.
    - Be sure to check again + add more when necessary
    

e. "Testing?"
- We have DOM testing; will improve it further
  * Replica of front-end available for unit testing; resolves issues for higher coverage
- Setting minimum coverage at 75% for testing
  * Big thing that TAs/class altogether is looking for
```

----------------

## Transparency About Grading
```
- Point in transparency in specifics is to not make us feel as if we are limited in what choose to do

- Graded on code quality
  * Easy to understand, easy to follow
- Think from the POV of a person that just joins the group
  * Good documentation, coding principles

- Keep sprint notes, standup notes, artifacts of the development process
  * Hold all files in 
  
- UI and UX
  * Focused heavily on UX for user experience rather than just appearance alone

- Not being compared to the outliers; 
```

----------

## Quick Improvements in Testing
```
- Testing improvements pushed to Main
- Be sure to pull them and use for own sections before making further PRs
  * Using function DOM(); for greater coverage
```
