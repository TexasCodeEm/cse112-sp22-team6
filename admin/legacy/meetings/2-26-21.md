# Our Thoughts of our Retrospective

Group used Retrium for group discussion
- Voting, visual organization
- Action plans

We have arranged synchronous standups with cams on
- Meeting for 15 minutes per standup to disclose our progress + upcoming plans
- Helps organize our mindsets together as a group

Focus on normalizing GitHub issues
- Work becoming more granular
- Many more issues, more being closed too!

Review of one-another's PR and code
- Still working on altogether, but more work shared among all

# Chad's Thoughts

"Who is responsible for PR reviews? What is the plan?"
```
- We encourage ourselves to assign reviews to necessary members (not just Viren and Arsen)
  * We still need more people to review altogether; can't just stack the responsibility on few people
  * This may cause blockage and less-varied critique
```

"Meeting documentation?"
```
- All lives on meetings branch
- Weekly PRs are made
  - meetings branch updated locally prior to merging to prevent conflicts

- Testing and JS documentation?
  * For updated pull requests, we have more data types + functions
  * Still working on for future improvements
  * Testing itself has improved immensely
    - Originally, some coverage being skipped on accident
  * interested in utilizing Cypress
```

"Roadmap Status?"
```
- Based on our initial programming roadmap
- What helped:
  * User stories, giving reminder of what our implmentations, improvements should be
  * 80% of all features from initial plan is implemented so far
```
"Can we finish?"
```
  - We're pretty confident with current progress
  - Chad: always totally fine if not everything can be made
  - Prepare on side in case we have to shave off any less-prioritized features/improvements
```

"How is our progress?"
```
  * Slowly and steadily; one main feature at a time
  * Rather than depth into a specific issue
```

"Specific features we are working on..."
```
- Past sprint meeting, we assigned more issues split across weeks 8 and 9 (some as urgent)
- Some issues under PR as of now
- Examples of current tasks:
  * start/reset augmentations, stats storage, pomo counter for tasks, etc.
  * Breaking apart tasks into granular portions
```

"Who is heading the Cypress testing?"
```
- Planned as Arsen, additionally Viren if necessary
- Connects to linting/organization of merges
  * Basically syncs with category of work
```

"How relative is the extent of our testing to our project?"
```
- Chad: Current tests good so far
- Recommend Cypress for UI
- String format testing
- For where we are, we have a good amount of testing
```

"Thoughts on Cypress"
```
- Our plan, may be part of manual testing (do locally to assure functionality)
- Chad's thoughts:
  * Himself, not the most familiar with Cypress
  * Has noted that other teams have had difficulties, so beware

- What other teams have
  * Deploying testing to external services (ie. FireBase)
  * Can run Cypress on deployed code to avoid DOM issues
```
"Rescaling? Grading?"
```
- Testing screen sizes, all the specifics
- Not extremely specfiic, but still considered
- VH, VW units?
  * Can look into these resources for additional review of our project

- So far, all units of our app are responsive through window resizing
- Overall: aspect ratios are considered in grading process
  * CSS animation, media queries are still good/recommended for continued use
```

# Final Recommendations

- Cut off work at Week 9
- Save week 10 for polish
  * Bug fixes, documentation, unit-testing finalizatoins

- Submission date of project......
  * Not 100% final
  * Aim for finals week (ie. the time slot for 110 final test period)
  * Is graded collectively by entire TA staff

- Best to complete and be comfortable with our final product early on
  * Although not rush, but save ourselves time for other dedications (finals... yikes!)
