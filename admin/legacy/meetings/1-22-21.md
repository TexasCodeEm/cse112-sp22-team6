### 1. Opening (Est. 5min)
```
- Overview of team GitHub/wiki/video/contract
- Expect new assignment to be released early this coming week
```

### 2. Chad's Advice (Est. 10min)
```
a. Chad recommends further specifications in group contract
  - Simplified, explicit bullets about responsbilities, expectations, and more (if necessary) will do
    * More specifics about the "when" and "how"
  - Otherwise, contract is just fine
  
b. Further defining our roles
  - So far:
    * Arsen/Viren: leading in meetings/organization | Michael B.: note-taking
    
  - Next roles and what to consider:
    * Will roles be concrete or vague?
    * Specialization in specific fields or dynamic across all efforts?
        - ie. devs write and test own code vs. devs passing work to members who create testing scripts with Git?
        
  - In the end: it's up to us
    * We can expect our workflow to solidify over time
    * For now, best we acknowledge/internalize these thoughts before next meeting
```

### 3. Next Week Plans & Closing Thoughts (Est. 5min)
```
a. Not everything truly solidified or figured out (that's fine!)
  * Good start given we are exploring these ideas ASAP
  
b. The app itself
  - It needs an "identity"
    * This is our app; we have the freedom to make it unique
  - Things to brainstorm
    * What is the app for? How will it be achieved?
    * What problems will it solve? How will we implement such features?
    * etc.
    
c. Lecture and lab content
  - Topics will continue to tie into the project itself (not all just abstract life-lessons)
  - Labs are more essential
    * Mainly to give us grasp of variety of tools we can select from
    
d. Next meeting
  - TBA
  - To be safe, Expect next Monday @5:00pm
```
