May 1. 2022 meeting to discuss Midterm and Dev process
------------------------------------------------------

People who attended: Jun, Austin, Baijun, Jinhao, Michael, Karina, Geewhan

Meeting Plan

-   Think about team questions for the midterm

-   Talk about pushing and pullingÂ 

-   We will do a practice merge request

Issues

-   Need to merge into our repo

-   We can merge without 2 reviews (it could be a problem)

-   Merge github to slack

Misc

-   If two developers are working on the same branch, then just push and pull to the same repo. Only make a PR to main once its finished.

-   For the current state (making more tests), we are doing it on a single repo.

-   Make sure to be transparent about our schedules, and set up rules.

-   Make sure to setup eslint, so that we all share the same coding style

-   Fix the package.json so that it fits our project needs.
