What we talked about

-   Midterm Grading

-   If you aren't sure how many points to assign, then contact Priyanka

-   There is no such thing as negative points. Start from full points, and then deduct points accordingly.Â 

-   After you grade the midterm, document the points on google sheets.

-   Bring the graded midterm back to class on Tuesday

-   For the class midterm, grade based on the answers we provided for the thing we needed to submit to Priyanka

-   For the 1st question, if the person only has 1 sentence, then they get partial points regardless of what we answered on the thing we submitted to Priyanka.
