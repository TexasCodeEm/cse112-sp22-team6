Feedback

- Hide button completely
  - Labels above the timer
- Instead of showing all three text with highlight, just show the current session
  - Option to show breaktime on tab or not
- Background
  - Option that’s completely plain
- A way to add tasks
  - Delete total tasks, does not make sense
- Complete task does not really make sense right now without user being able to specify
- Tutorial page
  - Info button should be next to the settings button
- Good with current load time optimization
- Separate testing and production server.
  - Push to testing server with CICD pipeline
  - Github action fail check the directory
- Code structure straightforward, might be better to put config into single folder, but low priority
- JSDocs
  - Certain format for comments for each function, each function’s parameter, need @
  - Graded JSDoc
