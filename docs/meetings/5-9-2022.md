May 9. 2022 meeting with Priyanka
---------------------------------

People who attended: Jun, Jinhao, Jason, Karina, Michael 

What we talked about

-   Grade midterm

-   Priyanka will assign points based on the previous answer keys we gave her

-   Each person grade 1 midterm, not their own

-   Why 12 principles should not be asked in the midterm, psychological safety in Waterfall vs. Agile

-   Some principles not practical

-   Lack of experience working in industry in waterfall vs. agile

-   Wording, we may understand but cannot memorize the exact wording. Maybe if the question was "Name 3 agile principles that matters most to you and explain,"

-   Overlap with agile values, "prioritize customer" = "prioritize working product"

-   How many can recite 12 principle

-   12 principles very abstract, it will be more helpful for us to learn it via practicing rather than memorization.  

-   Too short time preparation. 

-   "Name 1 agile principles that is demonstrated in your team's work"

-   Some projects do not fit all agile principles, need a mix of agile and waterfall. 

-   Presentation

-   What tasks we completed so far, problems that we identified & solved, highlight our values

-   Maintaining docs, using github issues 

-   Max 5 min

-   No live demo, can use video 

-   Tuesday or Thursday, TBD
