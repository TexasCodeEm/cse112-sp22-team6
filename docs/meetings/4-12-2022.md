Apr 12, 2022 Assignment Discussion:
-----------------------------------

Presentation on project evaluation criteria (5 slides)

TODO (Everyone) Finish before Wednesday Discussion (April 13 6pm)

-   Come up with one or two values/constraints regarding what matters to us in a project that makes it a good candidate. Put them as bullet points below. 

-   Include a name for the value/constraint, a short description (what it is and why it matters,) and optionally how we can quantify it.

-   Come up with Logo?

-   Come up with culture/goal/mission statement

-   Come up with Rules

Format

Documentation

-   Readability

-   Structure

Testing & Security

Performance

-   Bytes overhead

Culture(Developer's Experience)

-   Fast feedback

UX

Values:

Readability(accessibility): it's a group project and thus must be easy to maintain and improve for everyone in the group, and making sure everything is understandable is pretty important (had some incomprehensible stuff in 110). Hard to quantify. Code has comments for easier readability.

Usability(user-centered): The software should take into account the experience of the user. If the user does not have a good experience with the software, then we have failed to do our jobs as engineers. Usability can be measured by user demos and making sure that the software is also usable for people with different backgrounds.

Fast feedback: We value being able to find out whether a change has been successful in moments not days. It might be that unit tests have passed, or that we haven't broken production, or that a customer is happy with what we've built.

Repeatability (automation?): We value the confidence and predictability that comes from removing manual tasks that introduce weird inconsistencies. We also want to spend time on activities that are more important than troubleshooting something that should have just worked.

Simplicity: We value software that contains no more complexity than it needs to do a good job. We build for what we need now, not what we think might be coming*. But we make choices that allow our software to rapidly change to meet the requirements that are coming.

Clean Code. We value software that's easy to understand and maintain and is intention-revealing, as we know that this allows us to continue making changes with confidence, as we learn more about the problem.

Securability: It is important that the software is secure and that users' privacy is protected.

Constraints: 

Standardization: Everything from documentation to even meeting structure and code can be standardized, it smooths out the work process, makes it easier to make important decisions, and keeps everyone on the same page. Can look through project github to see if code/documents are in similar formats.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintainability: The codebase should be easy to maintain, and people should have a general understanding of the codebase. If the codebase is not maintainable, then it could lead to a ball of mud and tech debt. Maintainability can be achieved by understanding the codebase and using a set number of tools.

Time: We need to finish the project by the end of the quarter, so we need to estimate the amount of work needed to make the project a "1.0." Can be determined by the complexity of the code structure/ number of features and the

CI/CD

Technology/Tools: We need to pick a project that uses tools that the team is familiar with so that we don't spend too much time trying to learn new tools (ie Android Studio vs HTML and JS).
