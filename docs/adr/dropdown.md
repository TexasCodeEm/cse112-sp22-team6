## Context and Problem Statement

The original dropdown was implemented with divs, so it was really hard to style.

## Considered Options

* Keep trying to style it with divs
* Use native html select and option

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Native HTML using select and option

* Allows the app to be used on all devices without having to worry about
css issues that might come up.
