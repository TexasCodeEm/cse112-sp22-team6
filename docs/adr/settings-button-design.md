# Settings button design and layout 

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: All members of the team

## Context and Problem Statement

The original settings button was the same size as the settings button and was 
in the top left. After talking to Professor Powell and doing some research on 
UI design we realized this can be problematic as people read left to right and 
it was a large button so it would attract more attention than we want given 
we are trying to adhere to pomo principles and the button is irrelevant in 
majority of the uses. 

## Considered Options

* Reducing size of stats and settings button and moving settings to bottom left
* Reducing size of setting button but still keeping it in same location 
* Moving settings button to bottom left and stats to bottom right

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Reduce size of both stats and settings button and move settings button 
to bottom right. Overall we felt this adheres to design principles better and attracts 
less attention to buttons when they should be focusing on pomo.
