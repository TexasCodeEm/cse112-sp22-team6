# Settings button design and layout 

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: All members of the team

## Context and Problem Statement

After changing the design to keep maximal user attention on pomo we realized 
the buttons can still be a distraction to user if they are accessible when they 
should be focusing on pomo task. After discussing with Professor Powell, we felt confident that this was a problem that we needed to address. 

## Considered Options

* Potentially changing layout/design again to reduce distractions while in pomo 
* Disable buttons while in pomo since they should be focusing on task 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We ended up deciding to disable to buttons (tutorial, settings, stats)
while user is in pomo since they should be focusing on the task and these features 
serve as a distraction. We assessed that there is more utility for the user with the 
buttons being disabled while they are in middle of pomo in exchange for very small 
utility lost from not being able to access buttons during pomo cycle.
