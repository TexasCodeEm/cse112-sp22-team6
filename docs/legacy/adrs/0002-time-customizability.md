# Customizibility of duration of individual pomodoros, short breaks and long breaks

* Status: __acepted__
* Deciders: All members of the team
* Date: 01/28/2021

## Context and Problem Statement

There are accepted conventions of how long should individual pomodoros, short and long breaks run and we were faced with the problem of whether we should allow users to deviate from the convention and customize. Currently, the convention is 25 minute pomodoros, 5 minute short breaks and 15 minute long breaks.

## Considered Options

* Allow customization of all three timers
* Stick to Pomodoro conventions
* Limited options to choose from

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: option 2 because there are already different timers out there that allow users any type of customization but the key to the efficiency of the Pomodoro timer is its convention of those specific intervals that have withstand the test of the time.

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Option 1: Allow customization of all three timers

* Good, users will be able to adjust the timers to tailor it to their specific needs of work.
* Bad, because productivity tools already add a lot of friction and require decision making. Being able to customize adds the extra burden for the users to decide what set the timers to.
* Bad, customization of the timers gives huge number of combinations for users to choose from and too much of optionality is very stressing.

### Option 2: Stick to Pomodoro conventions

* Good, have withstand the test of the time for a few decades.
* Good, because users make less decisions and hence less frictions
* Good, because users don't have the option to mess with the timer in a way that is countrpoductive and make them discouraged in the product.
* Bad, not every user's work nature allows to take a break after 25 minutes.
* Bad, some user's tasks might be too intense and require longer breaks.

### Option 3: Limited options to choose from

An example would be a radiobox choice alowing either 25-5-15 or 40-10-30 combination.

* Good, because solves the problem of Option 2 of not fitting to some user's needs.
* Good, because solves the problem of Option 1 of having too many options too choose from.
* Bad, because extra development efforts required and might not be feasible to complete in the upcoming weeks.
* Bad, because there is no other combination that is able to solve the problem of fitting various needs without deviating too much from the original convention and becoming un-Pomodoro.
