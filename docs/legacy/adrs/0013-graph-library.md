# Using a library for graph statistics

## Context and Problem Statement
The current way the weekly statistics graph is being displayed is through an equation that
was made by the previous group. This causes the graph to look weird if there is one day that has much larger values than the rest of the days. 

## Considered Options
* Using a graphing library
  - using ZingChart as our graphing library
