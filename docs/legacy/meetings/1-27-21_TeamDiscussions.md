- Topic: Discussion of Groups' Progress
- Date: 1/27/21
- Time: 8:00am (Wednesday)

### Reminder: App is for <em>productivity</em>
```
  - Chad supports our single-page belief
  - Start with simplicity, complete the timer/basic functions prior to enhancements
    * Don't want to bite more than we can chew

  - Task tracking?
    - Would a user use that in a pomodoro app?
    - Or just use a differernt app?
      * Could even just use an API to another app that calculates analytics
```

## Discussion notes: cross-pollination of ideas between groups

```
Other apps:
a. Look into Pomofocus, Forest, Brainfocus
  - Great examples/competitors to research

b. What they do best
  - Sounds, animations, transitions, etc.
  
Reminders of pomo:
a. 25 minutes per session + 5 minutes break
b. 4 pomodoros + long break
```

### Problems to consider
```
a. Too many apps with too many features/distractions
b. User having to presss too many things or interact with app for too long
```

### User solutions
```
a. Minimal interaction between user and app
  - More automation; ie. audible cues to notify user when a pomo finishes
  - Different cues for taking breaks + 5 minute warnings + returning to work
  
b. On the other hand: preserving user input
  - Starting the timer, does it automatically send phone to sleep? (ie. presses off button for your)
  - A finishin pomo cycle automatically goes to break or requires user input to continue?
  - Tally marks for failed, fulfilled pomos; what data does the user want to track?
```

### Accessibility
```
a. Widen this as much as possible
  - Perhaps not just to students, but to anyone that just wants to focus on their work
b. Consider user-stories; what each kind of user wants from an app
  - ie. students want: aesthetic UI, to-do list, ...
    * programmers: friendly interface, ...
    * office workers: simplicity, reminders, ...
```
