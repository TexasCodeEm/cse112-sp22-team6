# Standup
```
a. Stats:
  - Implementations are complete!
  - Testing is all remaining
  - PR to be submitted by tonight

b. Timer bugs:
  - PR has already been submitted
  - Fixes for countdown delay and double click bug
```

# Stats Team - Graph

```
a. Josh research:
    * Way data extracted, cannot allow for history
    * Only support: 'today's data'
    * Rest of data combines into single values (can't be divided across days)

b. Graph visual framework
    * Assuming data points given, implementation itself will be simple
    * Rendering simple lines when stats page is opened
    * Real-time renders will be more difficult due to performance issues

c. Further thought
    * Date being stored as a key
    * Num. cycles per given task
    * Need num. cycles completed --> is for computing how much time focused for
      * Original idea: time-stamps, yet is too complex
      * Now: keep num. tasks per pomo-cycles
    * Not a problem how data is stored
    * Will be added as an issue

-------

**Task button - Viren, William**
```
- Task button disable
- Prompting user on break reset
```

**Organization**
```
- Having to download browserify
  * A very minor change in script to fix; Arsen will fix
```

**Accessibility Features:**
```
- Keystroke
- Color blindness
- Information/explanation text

- Can create left-side panel (mirror, or copy/past stats pane)
  * For holding slider customization and app description/info
  * Josh describes the pane process/coding as very simple
    - Just need to swap right to left for animation
```
