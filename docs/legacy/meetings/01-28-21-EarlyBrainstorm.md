User expectations

MAJOR GOAL FOR USER OF APP: Boost productivity!
```

## The Project Pitch
```
a.Problem:
- Difficulties in concentrating on work
  * Procrastination, distraction
  * We need a simple way to help make most of our time.

b. Appetite:
- Our group's time span of work: **6 weeks**

c. Solution:
- Pomodoro timer w/ start/end time functionality
- Data reported back for user to track performance
- To-do list (user provided) for user to map out objectives and estimate # of pomos to complete

d. Rabbit Holes:
- Situations we should avoid throughout our work
  * adding too many features (overwhelming expectations)
  * perfectionist design (start simple with main requirements BEFORE going beyond)

e. No-Go's:
- The pitfalls our group wants to aviod in order to maximize our productivity
  * Implementing an unnecessary pause feature
  * Implementing a skip feature (defeats the purpose of our app)
```

## Questions for Chad
