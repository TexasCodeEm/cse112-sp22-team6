## Wireframe Pitches and Ideas

- Time allotted: 4 hours
- Group members: Michael Brown, Amy Shen, Vedparkash Singh

Below is a link to the UI team's shared Figma document. This document contains a set of our earliest brainstorm pitches at the top of the screen. Below that is a rough draft wireframe with early sketches, redesigns, and plans for how the final UI should appear.

There exists a set of final images with designs that take inspiration from all original rough drafts as well as critique/input from earlier group meetings. The UI contains the background design as well as the colored appearance of the timer itself (in both the timing and rest stages) as well as layout and expectations of the statistics page.
