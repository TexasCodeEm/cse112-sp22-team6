## About
* Abe just recently retired and has the resources available to try out new things he's always wanted to do or learn. He enjoys what he does, but he still likes to see himself improve over time. He wants to be able to somehow schedule or block the time he invests in these activities so that he doesn't get tired or burnt out doing 1 thing and drop it. Instead, he is content with seeing his progress add up over time and being able to work towards some goal(s), bit-by-bit.

## User Story
As a user, I can see my past progress or progress over time so that I don't overdo work
and get burnt out, or spend too much time taking breaks and lose focus, enjoyment, and progress.
Seeing progress over time should allow me to see the results of my efforts and gain confidence
in the process, leading to less reliance on tools like the timer and find more, continued enjoyment
in certain activities.

## Use Case
#### Goal
* To organize and track time spent towards an activity and boost confidence and focus during work.

#### Steps in achieving that goal
1. Be able to see previous progress or usage of the timer and plan usage for the current day.
2. Record and track actual usage (without manual intervention) with no implications on correct or incorrect usage.
