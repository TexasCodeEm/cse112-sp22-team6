## About
 * Bob is a software engineer at Facebook who is currently working remotely. Because he is working remotely, he isn't able to seperate his personal and work lives to where he keeps debuging and improving his software until late into the night because he tends to get distracted by his kids during the day. Bob wants to implement a policy where he will only focus on one aspect of his life at a time and he wants to do this by initially finishing his work by 5pm and then spend quality time with his family. Right now, because he has the two things mixed, he can't seem to get any quality time in either aspect because the two are always mixed in his day at the same time.

## User Story
As a user, I can generate a report of my productivity during the day and track my progress over time. Furthermore, this allows me to stay disciplined with my time and makes sure I don't overdo the break which allows me to increase productivity with less time wasted. The app further allows me to not have to use any cognitive effort in keeping track of the time, so then all my efforts go towards my work.
