### About:

Devin is a simple man with simple needs. His work is always in-person as he tends to be tasked with filing many reports at a consistent pace. Work tends to be quite a bit stressful as a result and the monotony of the job doesn't help Devin cope with it. Procrastination tends to become a thorn in his side when boredom slowly kicks in.

### Needs:

As a result, Devin wants to be able to smoothly complete his work without the risk of distracting himself with any other actions. Devin wants to look forward to the completion of his work so that he will have free time to spare. For a pomodoro app, Devin wants to regain some self-encouragement by tracking his progress so that he feels accomplishment. 

## User Story

My job tends to be quite tedious and repetitive. I am always filing reports and filling out written documents at a consistent pace. However, the repetition makes me feel as if I am not making any progress at all. I decide to use a pomodoro app to remind myself whenever I need to take a break so that I work at a healthy rate. I also use this app for its progression features. I like to look back at my progress that is shown on the app so that I remember how much I am achieving so that I feel the encouragement to keep moving forward.

## Use Case

a. Goal
  - To display reminders via the pomo timer (25 minutes + 5 minute rest)

b. Steps
  - User starts timer on app
  - User enters list of items as a to-do list
    * At end of 4 pomo duration (long break), user can check off completed work
  - Progress display chart (minimalistic design)
