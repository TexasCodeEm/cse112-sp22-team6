## About  
Sarah is a historian who thinks there is always more to be learned about history. Trying to continusously excel in her field she uses her leisure time for active reading of History books and manuscripts. Sometimes those books are not particularly engaging and are mentally draining. However, she still needs to go through them to understand the broader context of historical events and make sure she is not missing any important historical fact.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be notified when reading timer expires without looking at it. Since reading history for me is not just a leisure but also a work, I have to be productive and be able to do that for prolonged time periods each day. I want to set short timers for reading and take breaks between them but not worry about checking whether the timer has stopped.  

## Use Case
#### Goal
* Be notified when the timers of pomodoros, short breaks and long breaks stop.  

#### Steps in achieving that goal
1. Audio notificaiton such as beeping whenever timers go off.
2. Visual notifications such as popups or exploding tomatos whenever the timers go off.
