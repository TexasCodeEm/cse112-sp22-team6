CI/CD pipeline phase 1 should be a vetting phase were you explore the following ideas
- linting and code style enforcement (may happen in pipeline and/or in editor)
  - Lint Action
- code quality via tool  (ex. Codeclimate, Codacy, etc.)
  - Explored: everything costed money
- code quality via human review (ex. Pull Requests)
  - Get 2 reviewers to approve the PR before merging
- unit tests via automation (ex. Jest, Tape, Ava, Cypress, Mocha/Chai, etc.)*
  - Vanilla???
- documentation generation via automation (ex. JSDocs)
  - JSDoc

*What do we do about npm???*

For the satisfactory completion of this phase you should provide
- a **diagram** of your phase 1 build pipeline
- a short **2 page status report** on the pipeline in terms of what works and what doesn't
- a no more than **2 min video** demonstration of the pipeline
