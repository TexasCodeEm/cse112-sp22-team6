### 2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

All team members shall:



*   Respond to Slack communication and emails in a timely manner (within 12 hours or sooner if urgent)
*   Respond to meeting time requests as soon as possible

### 3) Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)

All team members shall:



*   Attend the weekly meeting on Thursdays from 2-3 PM PST
*   Attend the weekly meeting with Chad on Fridays at 4 PM PST
*   Attend ad hoc meetings if necessary for project completion

For any meeting that needs to be scheduled:



*   Schedule request must be put in the Slack (e.g. when2meet, lettucemeet, doodle, etc.) at least 12 hours in advance
*   Once all members respond, an invite should be put on the calendar and a zoom link included in the description.

In the event that team members are unable to attend a weekly meeting, a new meeting time might be determined for that week. A team member that is unable to attend must give notice at least 12 hours in advance. 

### 4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members

All team members must



*   Complete assigned tasks and other action items in a timely manner.
*   Attend meetings as given above.
*   Be courteous and respectful to all other members on the team at all times.
*   Be responsible for the material covered in class and lab.
*   Be willing to assist other team members in need.
*   Prepare for meetings beforehand.
*   Communicate with coordinators and team members in the event that they cannot meet a deadline or a task is too large.

### 5) Conflict Resolution

In the event that a team member is not meeting deadlines, coordinators will communicate with the team member about responsibilities and re-assign tasks / re-evaluate deadlines accordingly. If this persists, coordinators will discuss with other team members on how to move forward and reach out to Chad if necessary.

In the event that there is a personal conflict among team members, coordinators will sit down with said members to discuss issues and potential compromise. Coordinators will re-assign tasks / re-evaluate deadlines based on the severity of the conflict. If this persists, coordinators will discuss with other team members on how to move forward and reach out to Chad if necessary. 

In the event where a team member has a personal emergency, the team member can optionally share information about their situation with the team. If they are uncomfortable doing so, they should reach out to Chad / Prof. Powell. In any case, some communication with the team is highly recommended.

### 6) Expectations of Faculty and TA’s

If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues. Team members should maintain a professional level of communication with faculty and TA’s and vice versa. TA’s are expected to provide mentorship and guidance to the team.
