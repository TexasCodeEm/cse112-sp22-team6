After collaborating via a live-coding session to complete our PRs, we moved on to our Retrospective Reflection. The snapshots below show some of our written thoughts as we engaged using Retrium.

*Side notes*
 * Technical debt is being well managed among ourselves
 * As for coding standards --> room for improvement (discussed further below)

*Side notes*
- Feature Branches
  * Creating more issues for specific features
- Revisit design and system diagrams
- More individual/async work on features
  * Work for any specific feature should be more granular
  * Each person able to work on own time outside of live-coding
  * ie. during live sessions, one person working / others watching
