# Standups

Viren:
- Completed team status video
- Worked with William to complete local storage implementations

William:
- Added new tests with storage, all passed
- Just needs merging
- Collaborated with Viren

Ved:
- Worked with Michael K. on stats issues
- Retrieving local data storage
- Setting graph interface
  - Thinking of nested list/array to piece together information
- Proposals:
  - May have to work with task button again to make sure all storage correctly retrieved/placed

Michael K.
- Synchronous work with Ved
- Data extraction
  - Use as variables to calculate later stats before display to stats
- Stats to implement:
  - num pomos completed, tasks completed, pomos interrupted
- Extracting local storage to update UI

Keshab
- Sound adding to timers
- Five second beeping noise
- Made design changes so text of timer is always centered in circle
  - Resizing, keeps text in center
  - However, circle itself does not resize; perhaps not something to worry about for now

Josh
- Plan:
  - Cleanup of remaining stats (ie. daily statistics)
  - Help with merging/linting

Amy
- Set up counters for current task / cycle
- Next is to complete CSS portion
- Reset will reset pomo cycle back to whichever it began on
  - ie. if on pomo 2, reset button will return back to 2

Michael
- Working locally
- Planning synchronous meeting with Keshab
- Still working on timer delay bug and visual notification/prompt on completing pomo cycle

Arsen
- Added linting
- Created comprehensive set of rules
  - We must make sure we run lint locally + fix linting errors before PRs
- Upcoming: modularizing code
  - Everyone needs to push all most-recent changes before-hand
  - Everyone should try merging by tonight
