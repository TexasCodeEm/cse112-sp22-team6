### Side-note: Good job everyone for completing week 3 assignments!

### 1. Task Management (Est. 10min)
```
(Slack feed was a bit flooded last-minute on Wednesday)
(We'll aim to organize our messaging for cleaner communication)

a. GitHub projects tab
  - For assigning/distributing specific tasks among members
  - Provides individual feeds of progress: "to-do" / "in-progress" / "done"
  - Feel free to tinker with features for familiarity

b. iMessage
  - Viren will create a group chat
  - Reserve for important and/or urgent communication

c. Slack
  - Will continue to use
  - Additional channels recommended
    * ie. for videos, assignments, deadline reminders, discussions, etc.
```

### 2. Meeting Time Updates (Est. 5min)
```
a. Mondays @ 5:00pm
  - Helpful in case assignments/deadlines crowd the end of the week
  - Mondays will give us more time to prep
  - Stay tuned on Slack for meeting notifications

b. Thursdays @ 2:00pm
  - Still reserved (will be meeting on 1/28/21 for early design brainstorming)
  - Workloads may eventually accumulate; Thursdays hence give us more time to collaborate when necessary

  - Unchanged
```

### 3. Future prep + Side notes (Est. 10min)
```
a. Prep for Chad
