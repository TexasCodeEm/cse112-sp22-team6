## Step Through (Showcasing our Progress So Far...)

```
a. Miro Board Showcase
  - Need to simplify further as time progresses
  - So far, a very solid foundation
    
b. User-Centered Documents
  - Individually created
  - Personas: outlining the users we are targeting
    * Who wants the app? What will they expect and why?
```

## Consensus shared w/ Chad
```
a. We want to generalize the target audience (not specificity)
b. Limiting user interaction
```

## Question from Chad
```
Question: 
  - If targeting a general audience, why would a general user select out pomodoro app over others?
    * How about someone selecting an app specifically tailored to themselves?

Response:
- Individuals' work -- already quite generalized in today's fields
- Can contribute to a more minimalistic design for the app (not having to be too specific to any one tailored group)
  * Too many features will confuse the user
- Supports our workload
  * Construct what is necessary, followed by what we wish to expand upon
```

## Diagrams
```
C4
  - diagrams are very general at top-level
    * as you create more diagrams, will become more and more specific/concrete

UML Diagrams
- Focuses on literal interactions between objects rather than abstract ideas/features
- For critical parts of our system
```

## Overall
```
Chad enjoys what we've accomplished thus far
- We've defined our problems and the user population

- Next stages: 
  - For user stories, focus on more specific ways that the app supports users
  - Delve into further market research
  - Begin mapping out UI
  - In general, just refinement in what we've produced thus far
```


## Next Week

- Thinking about the user interface
```
**Users** ---> informs the problem(s)

**Problem** ---> informs the necessary features

**Features** --> inform our User Interface
```

Meeting planeed on Monday
- Once more for final clarifications of current progress
- Acknowledgement of Chad's advice
  * Tieing in personas
  * Market research
  * Basic drawing of UI
