### Side Notes (as of 1/19/21 from Lab 3 Zoom Session)

```
- Ways to create Group Wiki Page:
  1. someone applies for GitHub educational package (called the Student Dev. Pack, I believe)
    * allows for Wiki Page
    * would require someone to make personal repo
  2. instructor applies for GitHub instructor license to enable wiki
