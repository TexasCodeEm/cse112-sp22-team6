# Interface/Rough
We will initially capture "fat marker design" later extended with wireframes and high fidelity prototypes.

## Documented ideas
- Encouraging minimal user interaction
    - When starting a pomo cycle, user sees numbers (ie. 25:00 at start of cycle)
    - Clock fades; UI shows hands of clock for less distraction to user
        - Tapping clock reveals exact timer before fading/transitioning back to showing hands of clock again
- Different backgrounds depending on the time of day

- Start button
- Stop/reset button 
- After cycle completion, urge user to initiate next cycle
