# Project Roadmap

## Sprint 1 -- Finished
### Finalize design
ADRs
- Limited User Interaction: ensuring our product adheres to Pomodoro principles of simplicity and avoiding distractions
- Time Customizability: decreasing the number of decisions the user has to make
- Broad Problem Focus: focusing on simplicity and the general case user instead of a specific sub-group

System Design
- Draw up C4 Diagram
- Start Event Modeling using flowchart models

User Thinking
- Build personas, use cases, and user stories
- Link them to core features

Finalized Wireframes
- Design UI and basic UX flows in Figma
- Ensure design meets Pomodoro principles
- Design with constraints in mind: 5 weeks for development

### Team Coherence
Pitch
- Collaborate on presentation based on "Shape Up" method

Start the Agile Process 
- Stand-up Meetings: send standup reports every other day

Build Pipeline
- Will implement ESLint for linting
- Will implement JSDocs for generating documentation
- Setting up 2 reviewers for each PR
- Brainstorm and explore options for unit tests and automated code review
