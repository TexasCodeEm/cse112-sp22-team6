* Status: accepted
* Deciders: all members of the team
* Date: 01/28/2021

## Context and Problem Statement

We were deciding whether we wanted to narrow our focus for the Pomodoro timer down to a specific group of users and/or problems or to maintain a broad focus.

## Considered Options

* broad problem focus
  - designed to appeal to a broad range of users
* narrow focus down to specific group of users/problems
  - students for studying and completing assignments
  - people working at desk jobs

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: broad problem focus, because

* Time management is an issue for a wide variety of people in different situations.
* There are many different types of problems or tasks that can be completed with the use of a timer.

## Pros and Cons of Other Options

### Narrow problem focus

* Pro: focused on and thus better appeals to specific group of users
* Con: can be unfitting for the needs of other groups of users
